These aren't just any tools I look up online; they're the ones that have personally use everyday to improve how I live.

Dramatic Pause

Let me be straight with you: I've always felt like I wasn't quite measuring up. You know that feeling when you're in a competitive game, and no matter how hard you try, you can't seem to catch up? Or that the people around you have some edge that you don't. 

{{kingsmen scene}}

Yeah, that feeling. 

That was my daily. I'd push myself to the limit but never quite being where I wanted. 

I'm Jay. I've worked in big tech, VC, and have built AI apps. For the last four years I've searched and used over 100 AI tools. Today, I've boiled it down to these three AI tools. Forget the jargon and complexity; we're focusing on what really matters: results. 

Introduction to the Tools (1:00-1:30)

These tools:
- Get you reliable information you need, fast.
- Connect your mind to the digtal world 6x faster.
- Transform your digital work to fun and productive hobbies.

Let's get started.

Tool #1: Perplexity: The Search Revolution  (2:30-3:30)

Promise
Over the last couple of years it feels like the information on Google has downgraded. A lot. If I do find something helpful from Google more often it is because it routed me to Reddit.

But, then Google introduced AI summarizes. So, I thought: ah, what a relief. Google is going to keep doing their information thing. 

But, then I realized the outputs were more wrong than vanilla ChatGPT!

So, I decided to try Perplexity.

With Perplexity, and specifically their new Deep Research the internet has finally been made intelligent.

Journey

I was skeptical—Google's the search king, right? But Perplexity changed my mind. The biggest issue with LLMs are their ability to hallucinate. They'll literally just make up convicing sounding slop when you least expect it. 

With perplexity - it sites its sources. 

For really fast questions that I want a quick answer to I just quickly type in my question and get the answer.

Magic.

About two weeks ago, Perplexity released a new tool: Deep Research. This is for bigger questions like: 
- What is the meaning of life?
- How do I build a business from the ground up?
- How can I self-teach myself physics. 

Deep Research spends a lot of time researching and and compiling the information it finds. It can cover 30+ real sources, and seamlessly generate a comprehensive report. And, this of knowledge is free.

Whether it's for a school paper or staying informed on the latest tech trends, 

Perplexity is my go-to. It's especially useful when you need to cut through the AI-generated slop.

Transition
With the right knowledge, you can build anything. But every craftman still needs their tools. The next tool can be help you speedrun all of your work. Let's see how.

Tool #2: Superwhisper (3:30-4:30)

Promise
Superwhipser - become 6 times faster online.

Journey

In gaming, voice chat is a game-changer—quick communication, real-time strategy. It’s the difference between winning and losing. So, when I saw SuperWhipser I immediately recognized how much of a winning tool it was. 

Before we dive in, let's explore this problem that most people don't realize is a problem. Typing. 

The average person types at 40 words per minute, but the average person speaks at 250 words per minute. 

The average office worker types 3,500 words per day. So, roughlly let's imagine I spend 87.5 minutes a day just typing. Sure.

But, what if I could type as fast as I spoke? 

If I spoke everything instead then I would be just 14 minutes per day. {on screen calculations} 

 That would save 33 minutes a day or...
 
{drumroll}

  192.5 hours per year. 

{WOW voice}

 With Superwhisper, I breeze through my tasks at literal superhuman typing speeds. 
 
 It's like being used to driving to Disney, but then one year fly instead.

So now, I'm able to write more quickly and naturally. Talk to I talk to my computer and watch my code appear. 

But, I will warn there is a bit of a goofy lean that I find myself doing - especially if I'm in public and literally trying to whisper to the tool. So, if you're on the free tier the accuracy can lead to unexpected spelling errors. 

Transition
Speed is just one part of the equation. When it comes to building and creating, you need tools that make complex tasks feel fun. Let's see how the next tool can turn your work into a feeling like a hobby.


Tool #3: AI Coding and Writing Assistant (Cursor) (4:30-5:30)
Promise
Welcome to coding you'll actually love. And, even if you're not a coder stay with me. You almost certainly have to write things. I'll show you how to use Cursor to super-charge your writing. 

Journey
Coding was something I knew was important. Loved being close to. But dreaded actually doing—endless debugging, cryptic errors, constant frustration sucked.

But, Cursor came along. 

There are a lot of video explaining how to best use Cursor for coding, so I won't go too deep into it now. 

But, what I will say it that the Cursor team developed a product that makes building software so fun it has legitimately become my favorite way to spend free time. 

So, if you want to build something or make money online I strongly recommend you at least try it. 

But, what if you have no interest in coding? 

Let me introduce you to another use-case I don't see NEARLY enough people talking about. Cursor for... writing.

Writing has a lot of the same painpoints that coding does but it is more widely used. For example: 
- You have to write a script when making a YouTube video
- You have to writes tons of emails in the work place
- You have to write notes as a student

After using SuperWhisper to write 6x faster, you can use Cursor to edit your writing 10X times faster.

Reward
Now, with Cursor I can take work that we have to do and turn them into work I want to do. It's fun, and I'm more productive than ever. Use it to bring your software or written ideas to life.

The Big Picture (5:30-7:00)

Now, you might be wondering—why does all this matter? Let me share what I've learned from using AI tools non-stop for years.

Each of these tools is like a key that unlocks new doors—doors to new ideas, creations, and ways of connecting with the world. Learning and using these AI tools is like removing weights from your legs; suddenly, you're not just keeping up, you're sprinting ahead.

We've only scratched the surface today. There's a whole universe of AI tools out there, each with the potential to amplify your abilities. And, as models become better exisiting tools are becoming better. The key isn't to become an AI expert overnight; it's to start, to take that first step.

Honestly, I was intimidated at first. AI felt like something from the future, something complicated. But I realized that the future is here, and it's surprisingly accessible. And with all the hype, it's easy to be skeptical—but these tools have proven reliable, helping me and others achieve more. Occaisonally when the hype wave feels too much I like to take a step back and remind myself the biggest regret I could have is watching the future unfold from the sidelines.

For me these tools aren't about replacing humans; it's about amplifying them. It's about unlocking potential I never knew I had. It's about building a future where everyone can create, contribute, and thrive.

If you found a tool or application of the tool that sparks your curiosity, or got value from this video please share the video with a friend. It is the best way to help my new channel grow.

Closing Sequence (7:00-7:30)
Thank you for watching. Remember, the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. Take that step today, and step into your new superpowers.
