[PERSONAL JOURNEY SECTION]
**Journey**: 
[Timeline graphic showing career struggles]
- Summer 2020: Feeling overwhelmed in VC
- Fall 2022: Layoff moment
- Late 2022: ChatGPT changes everything

[EMOTIONAL HOOK]
I've always struggled with feeling not good enough. Picture this scene from Kingsman [Brief clip reference] - that's how I felt, constantly pushing against walls, hoping for a breakthrough.

[TRANSITION TO MAIN CONTENT]
But everything changed when I leaned into AI tools. I realized something powerful: With AI, anyone could achieve greatness.

That's why I'm making this video and every video to come. Let's get started.

[SECTION PREVIEW]
In this video, we'll dive into the exact tools I use daily, split into two main categories:
1. Knowledge Tools - For learning and information processing
2. Development Tools - For creating and building

While you may not be a developer, take the principles you learn here and apply them to your own work.
