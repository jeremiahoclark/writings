#  If you're not using AI apps in 2025, you're at a huge disadvantage 

Have you ever felt like you're running a marathon with ankle weights, watching others sprint effortlessly ahead?

In the Summer of 2020, I placed my name in the GPT-3 API access waitlist and waited eagerly. Soon, I got a message from a friend who worked on Product at OpenAI. She told me that she saw my name on the waitlist for GPT-3 API access and moved me up the list - I was in. 

I built some basic API interactions and showed my manager - also a technophile. We were both blown away by the technology. But, I was so busy with the day-to-day demands of Venture Capital that I wasn't able to spend nearly as much time as I wanted building in it. 

I've always had a feeling that I wasn't good enough. 

The mental image that often came to mind - especially when I started in my career - was a scene from Kingsman. In the scene, the protagonist - unaware of the physics to create an air siphon from a toilet - bangs against the wall before he drowns in a room full of water. He eventually breaks through -- barely surviving.

For most of my career, I felt like I was banging my fist against the wall hoping it would break open. This insecurity drove me to do the only thing that I could-- work more. At LinkedIn, I became known for staying late. At Pinterest, I'd work to 3 am and sleep in the office.

However, in the fall of 2022, this feeling of inadequacy within me was larger than ever. My firm, in response to the VC industry slowdown, laid off operations staff - me, the "Head of Business Operations," included. It felt like a punch in the gut and a release of the pressure I had been holding at the same time. Someone else had put my career on pause, but I was free to do what I wanted. 

Two weeks later, OpenAI released ChatGPT. Like much of the internet, I was completely stunned by the interface. I had experience with the model before, but this time was very different. 

My response to the lay-off and the release of ChatGPT was that I had determined to integrate this technology into my life as much as possible. I thought: I may be a B+ player on my own, but with AI, I could compete with anyone in the world. 

Since then, my old habits from my VC days haven't left me. For fun, I've tested hundreds of AI applications over the past 2 years. 

From those, 11 tools have stuck to me. I enjoy them and they've completely transformed how I work, learn, and grow as a person.

Below is a collection of these tools and how I use them.

## Knowledge Tools

### Claude: The Creative
Claude is fast and precise in complex tasks. For many, including myself, it is the first model for coding. What makes Claude great in its coding ability is its creativity. 

My typical workflow for designing a new feature starts off with me describing what I want to build to Claude. Often, I start with a simple ask: 
"Design a loading page that allows me to play a simple game while I wait". 

Then I focus on improving the output with one focused request at a time. 

While many put Claude in a "good for coding" box, I'd argue that its creativity makes it fantastic for writing as well.

I've recently tested the major models in question generation for an upcoming SQL learning application. Claude created high-quality questions with the **most variety** compared to the other major models.

Its higher quality design skills and coding ability combine to make Claude the best model for agentic frameworks. 

[ Small purple box:
What are agents and agentic frameworks? 
Let me start by defining large language models, or also referred to as simply "models".  

Large language models are language prediction machines. They take trillions of pieces of data and compile them down to billions of tiny knobs and dials. These digital knobs and dials are called parameters. Parameters are like a massive control panel where each dial represents a pattern the AI has learned. Models take in input, like a question, and they predict the most likely answer. 

Recently, these models have been given an ability called "tool use". Tool use is the ability for models to use pre-made code. Imagine I had pre-made code that calls my mom. Models can now activate that code to call my mom on my behalf. This now allows models to become action-oriented. So, we now give action-oriented models, who can call my mom, a new name "agent".

One-off use-cases like phone dialing is fine, but it would be great if the AI knew when I had a problem and called my mom to tell her I need advice. This requires multiple steps to solve an amorphous problem. So, to solve this problem we can form teams of agents that work together -- called frameworks. One agent determines if I have a problem, and the other calls my mom to tell her what problem I have. The formation process of models working together are agentic frameworks. 

Agentic frameworks appear to be the next frontier of AI. Frameworks may be capable of anything humans can do on the computer - and do tasks we humans cannot.

Moonwalking back to Claude. Claude is very good at cooperation. Claude is extremely well-positioned in the upcoming wave of agents appearing on the internet. Claude has driven some of the coolest use cases of agents on the web so far: Cursor agents and Claude Engineer. We'll talk about both of these use cases below. 

Claude is very good at being Claude. From personal uses to agents, I've found the less I try to limit Claude's creativity, the more I am delighted.

### OpenAI 01: The Architect 
While Claude excels in creativity, OpenAI 01 shines in deep reasoning. 

I label O1 the architect, because it thinks well at the systems level. Here's an overview of some of the buckets of tasks that I find myself using O1 the most for. 

- [Coding] A bug sometimes may be the result of the mismatch of many individual files of code. O1 can overlay that code and find the mismatch where other models cannot. 
- [Research] O1 excels not at just giving me the conclusion of knowledge, but it provides me with a perspective
- [Strategy / Decision Making] Life is about decisions. Decisions are about trade-offs. O1 approaches decisions by presenting the trade-offs and a logical recommendation

I recently gave O1 one of my Q1 2025 goals. I have a lot to say but don't know how I should best get my message into the world. 

So, I gave O1 as much context into who I am as I could. Then asked it to help me create a content strategy that is streamlined (doesn't take too much time each week) and allows me to showcase what I care most about. I liked the first output and am currently executing *its* plan.

If you're not coding regularly, then I'd recommend try using O1 to design a system around something that you deeply care about. For example, try this prompt:
"Please design a system that allows me to [insert your goal here] in [insert your time constraint here]. ## Context: ## [insert your as much context as you can as you can here]."

If I'm looking to solve a system-level problem, O1 is where I start. But, if I'm looking for a quick answer, I'll often turn to Perplexity. 

### Perplexity: Bye Bye Google

For me, Perplexity has largely replaced traditional search for questions that I have. While Google remains useful for finding specific websites, Perplexity excels at:
- Synthesizing information across multiple sources
- Providing direct answers with verifiable citations
- Delivering real-time data 

When I first started using Perplexity, I immediately tried to replace my browser's default engine with it. This was a mistake. It took me two days before I reverted back to Google. 

I've found myself using Perplexity gradually more and more. 
For example, I recently asked it specific questions about a Youtube creator's content: 
"What was Laoshu505000's method to language learning?"

Or recent political quagmires: 
"Why does President Trump want to acquire Greenland?"

Slowly I realized that Perplexity had two distinct advantages: quality and speed. 

A year and a half later, I've virtually stopped using Google. Crazy. I know. But, stay with me.

There are three things that are working against Google:

1) The quality of Perplexity's answers are better than Google's summarized response

2) AI is producing a lot of mid-quality SEO articles that don't actually help answer the questions I may have 

3) If I want to dive deeply into a subject, I'll often watch creators on YouTube in long-form. 

The exception of when I do use Google is when I'm too lazy to type the .com of a website. 

That all the Google Search bashing aside, there is an AI product that Google has produced that I find myself talking to in the late nights and early mornings. Gemini Live.

### Gemini Live: My Language Partner
Gemini Live transforms language learning through:
- Natural conversation flow in multiple languages
- The ability to see my screen
- Price 

Up until the last month of 2024, I obsessed over ChatGPT's Advanced Voice mode. It would've easily been in this position. I desperately wanted to add it to my existing apps and create a series of apps with it at the core. 

But. It is expensive. Very expensive. The unit economics for Advanced Voice makes it very difficult to use for anything other than replacing human call centers. 

Even with the OpenAI plus subscription, you only get 1 hour a day with Advanced Voice mode to practice language learning or talk about your feelings. 

In December, seemingly out of the blue, Google released Gemini Live under the name "Gemini Flash 2.0 Experimental Stream Realtime". Despite its poor naming, this model provides some of my most memorable moments with AI.

In the last month, I've used Gemini Live to be a free, high-quality language tutor. It has translated for me live while I played a Japanese Pokemon game. And, been an "always available" practice buddy for Japanese and Spanish (unfortunately, its Chinese isn't there yet).

I've tested it in a number of ways it probably shouldn't be used - like as a therapist and as subtitle maker.

If you're just getting started with Gemini Live, try make sure you give it special instructions for how you want it to interact with you. And, never ever use the Puck voice. It's just disturbing. I don't know what it is but the Puck voice haunts me.

Gemini Live is still in its beta phase, limiting it to personal use. However, I'm extremely looking forward to incorporating it my products in the future like LumiReader.ai.

### LumiReader.ai 

LumiReader helps those who are learning languages by: 
- Enabling users to personalize their favorite content to their reading level
- Giving users tons of listening practice
- Helping learners discover new stories they wouldn't have seen before

I developed LumiReader.ai to provide language learners a way to break through intermediate hell.  

When I was learning Chinese, I found reading to be an amazing way to level up my proficiency. However, all of the content that I could read that was available were children's books. I have a limited amount of free time and wanted to read books about topics I enjoyed, like biographies of founders.

Lumi solves this problem by using AI to simplify their favorite books to their reading level in any language. Even more, Lumi can read the book aloud to the users as well. 

I've used it to read stories in Chinese, Japanese, and Spanish and am excited by the things I have in store for the future of the product. 


## Productivity Enhancers

### Krisp: My Meeting Voice Isolator
Krisp transforms virtual meetings through:
- High-quality voice isolation in any environment
- Accurate meeting transcription and summarization
- Automated action item extraction

Beyond just noise cancellation, Krisp has become my secret weapon for meeting productivity. The AI transcribes everything in real-time, and after each meeting, I get a clean summary with action items already pulled out. 

As someone who often (read almost always) works from a coffee shop, Krisp is a massive unlock. 

What I love most is that it's completely invisible to others - they just hear my crystal-clear voice, whether I'm next to a screaming espresso machine or working outside next to a busy street. For a nomad like me, it's the difference between running around looking for a quiet place to take a call and being the one with the cleanest audio and coolest background in the meeting.

Most recently I used Krisp to transcibe user interviews. Instead of digging through my notes or recording, I can just copy and paste the transcript into chatGPT and ask it to find the relevant information and pull out trends across users.

Once, I use Krisp get the information from user interviews, I then start to build the features to solve the problems that users have. And, that where the next set of tools come in. 

## Development Tools

Before you just skip through this section, because you don't code, let me explain why you should care. It's not that these tools are good at coding, but reading about them will help you know what's possible. Plus, I've added some additional context for people who don't code. 

### V0: Go from Idea to App in Minutes

Regardless of if you are just getting into web app development or you're a seasoned veteran, V0 is an app you can't sleep on. 

I've never given Figma enough time to learn how to quickly prototype within. Fortunately, V0 gives me an out. 

I can quickly type my ideas, for say solving user problems, and within 5 minutes have a functioning prototype.   

V0 is like having a design wizard and front-end developer sitting right next to you. Let me walk you through how I typically use it. I'll start by describing the core functionality I want like a dashboard for tracking language learning progress for LumiReader.ai. I'll type something like "Create a clean, minimalist landing page with a hero section that shows a book being translated in real-time" and boom - V0 generates a responsive, good-looking React component that's pretty close to what I was imagining.

The magic isn't just in the initial generation, but in how quickly I can iterate. Don't like the color scheme? I can tweak the prompt. Want a different layout? A few words and the entire design shifts. It's like having a design partner who never gets tired and understands exactly what you're thinking.

From there I can quickly deploy to Vercel. However, I'd recommend starting a Next.js application on your computer and downloading the code. 

After I've finished modify the v0 of the design, I then hop over to Cursor to integrate the code into my app or deploy it directly to Vercel. 

### Cursor: My Coding Second Brain

Built on top of Microsoft's VSCode, Cursor converts code into joy. It has:
- Context-aware code completion
- Intelligent refactoring suggestions
- Automated documentation generation
- Agents that can automate coding workflows 
- Chat so that you can learn from a codebase

My experience and my observations of watching those I recommend Cursor to has been a change of perspective. The tool is so good that coding for hours has become how I like to spend my free time or relax. 

The feeling comes from a combination of all of its features working to take much of the bad parts of coding out and boost the good parts.  

My favorite feature is their cursor agent. It is a tool that largely takes over your coding workflow. It can help you write code, refactor, and even access your terminal to deploy your code. 

"Hey Jay, that's cool and all but I don't code and don't want to." 

Let me show you two ways that you can use Cursor even if you don't code. 

1) You can use Cursor to write content. 

You can highlight a section of text and ask Cursor to rewrite it *in your own voice*. You can also reference multiple files that you've written in the past or research that you want to include. It is automatically connected to your browser and can search the web for you. 

2) You can use Cursor to help you learn languages. 

One of the best ways to practice a new language is by journling. Moving your journal into a cursor can help you supercharge your vocabulary and output ability. 

For example, say you're learning Chinese and journaling your. And you want to say something more complex than your normal "I went to the store and bought groceries" in your target language:

我去商店买了杂货。

You can highlight the sentence and ask Cursor to rewrite it using one new more advance word.

我前往商店买了杂货。

New word: 前往 (qián wǎng) - to go to, to proceed to

While cursor is great for coding, it is even better as a second brain. Whether you use it to write the next billion dollar app or all of your journal entries, it is a powerful tool to not be slept on. 

And, with cursor agent, it is even better. But, if you want to learn more about how agents work. I recommend getting your hands dirty with Claude Engineer.

### Claude Engineer: Rapid Application Development

For building new applications, Claude Engineer offers:
- Full-stack code generation
- Architecture optimization
- Automated testing and documentation

Claude Engineer was built by one of my favorite creators in the AI space, Pietro Schirano. 

Claude Engineer (originally called Maestro) is an agentic framework -- see we see it again -- that creates great code. 

I'm deeply impressed by Claude Engineer. The framework's ability to self-improve and generate its own tools through conversation is mind-blowing - I've used it to create everything from web scrapers to seo boosters. What's particularly cool is that it uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet under the hood, and each tool you create becomes part of a growing ecosystem that makes the next tool even smarter.

The only downside is that it is expensive. It costs a significant amount of money to *learn to how to use it*. But, at the same time you get what you pay for. Claude Sonnet is the best model for agentic frameworks.

More than anything, I've found that Claude Engineer is the best way to build deep understanding of agents and agentic frameworks. After diving into it, you'll be parse out a reply bot that's called an agent from and actual AI agent. 

## Picture Generation Tools

### X.ai: Less Censored Flux

Flux is an open-sourced model that came from an unknown lab and broke the internet last year. It took photorealistic photos and photos with accurate words to the next level. 

I'm subscribed to X. And, Flux is what powers X.AI's image generation. 

I've used Flux for client engagements to show realistic mock-ups. It's a game-changer when you need to quickly build assets.

 I can describe what I want ("generate a photo of people exchanging business languages and culture"), and within seconds, I've got a professional-looking design that actually makes sense. 
 
It's become my go-to for that crucial first client presentation when you need to show them you're not just talking, but can deliver something tangible.

Although, I've found that Flux is best for creating images that are photorealistic. If you want to create images that are more abstract, I recommend Midjourney.

### Midjourney: The First Greatest

Midjourney used to lead in visual generation. It has: 
- Photorealistic image creation
- Consistent style maintenance
- Intuitive prompt interpretation

Due to Flux, I find myself mostly using Midjourney when I want to produce images that look drawn. 

I used Midjourney to create all of the images for the provided library in Lumi. 

[examples]


Midjourney is also unique because it first simply used Discord as its main interface. It demonstrated that you can build a great company in non-conventional ways with AI. 


## Honorable Mentions

So, we've covered a lot of tools. But, there are a few more that I think are dope but I don't personally use: 

There are of course AI tools that I think are nifty but don't personally use: 
- SuperWhisper - AI transcription. I'm building my own tooling around speech-to-text around very specific use case. 
- Superhuman - AI email assistant. It's great, but I've built my own email helper bot, called Navi. 
- Lindy.ai - AI first Zapier. I've built my own tooling around automations with AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Run. 
- Replit Agent - AI agent that builds an app for you end-to-end database and auth set up. I've built my own tooling around automations. 
- Whispr Flow - Better dictation in a ton of applications. I've built my own tooling around speech-to-text. 
- Grok AI - Honestly, I use Grok like I use Perplexity to give me a summary of what's happening in the world. But, I find myself distacted by the rest of what is happening on X. Plus I can call Perplexity extremely quickly from my Arc browser. 

## The Compounding Effect

The real power of these tools lies in their ability to compound your capabilities over time. Each tool you master makes you more efficient. Each tool gives you the space to learn the next one. And, the next. This is creating a flywheel effect in your professional and personal growth.

While many dream of AI allowing us to do less work, for me I love to use AI to extend myself. AI allows me to do more at a higher quality than ever before. 

And, hopefully by using some of these tools, it can help you too.

## Looking Forward

These 11 tools represent the current state of the art, but the landscape is evolving exponentially more rapidly. The key to adaptability is to focus on what interests you. When you see a new tool, ask yourself: "How can this help me do what I already do faster or easier?" 

From my perspective, there are two kinds of people in the AI camp: those who want to replace humans and those who want to augment them. I am firmly in the latter, and I suspect if you've made it this far that you are too. These tools are powerful amplifiers. Choose your starting point carefully, master it completely, and let me know what you build from there. So whether you’re brand new to AI or you’ve already been tinkering for years, join me on this wild ride. Let’s see what we can build together.

Looking forward,
Jay
