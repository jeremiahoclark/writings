I've spent over 3 years and thousands of dollars learning Chinese for one day of exploring the world's most sophisticated tiny homes.  

Before I dive into this covnersation topic, I want to reflect on a surreal feeling. I'm writing article from a rail train going from Guangzhou to Shenzhen China. That may not feel like a big deal to you, but to me that is pretty insane. I've spent years studying the hardest language in the world for a single day. 

It was worth every second. 

What is more, is that this all started because of a dream. 

Let's rewind to October 2021. 

I was grining away in my Sales Ops job. The clock read 11:30 p.m. Even though I had this feeling of restlessness in my chest, I knew it was time to sleep. 

I made my way to bed and closed my eyes. I then proceeded to have one of the most intense dreams of my life. In it I was speaking with an entity that appeared as a gray silohuette against an endless black background. 

It told me I was to learn Chinese. I saw myself in China holding a piece of technology that I was excited to bring to the U.S. It told me that I was a builder like my grandfather. 

The next morning I was filled with a deep unignorable drive to begin learning Chinese. And so, I did. 

"Wait, J, are you telling me you did all of this - going to China, seeking tiny homes, and learning Chinese because of a dream?!"

Yes. Fortunately, what I got along the way has been more meaningful in my life than anything else so far. So, allow me the rest of this piece to share a bit of what I've found with you. 

## The Problem ##

The U.S. has a big housing problem. It started with the '08 housing crisis and it hasn't gotten any better since then. 

Here is a chart of how many first home owner homes were build the U.S. and how much demand we've had in the last 17 years.

 There are many drivers to why we have this issue, but at the core it is a supply issue. However, when we ask: "why is the supply so low?". We start to see many compounding variables: 
 - Local and State ordinances often make it difficult for builders to build
 - Financial pressures make it difficult for builders to finance building projects
 - Super banks (read BlackRock) bought and held many prime housing opportunties (they own xx% of homes in California)
 - Inflation. Homes prices have increased much faster than real wages. People now discovering their homes are worth much more have also realized any home they'd like to upgrade to has also increased in price -- often beyond what they could afford. 
 - Intensification of natural disasters like hurricanes in through the South East and fires in the West.

There is a solution to this problem. We build more homes. 

Enter the tiny home. 

In many parts of the world like Japan, households are used to making a lot of of a tiny living area. However, American taste has generally been that bigger = better.
